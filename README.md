## Configuration

Sheet information for the TBM page is stored in `sheetConfig.js`. Update the
following constants in that file to change the data sources without touching the
application logic:

- `SHEET_BASE_URL`
- `METIER_TO_GID`
- `TBM_GID`

After editing `sheetConfig.js`, reload `tbm.html` to use the new values.
